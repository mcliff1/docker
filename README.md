# Docker
collection of docker and container utilities
(as of 2021-03 there is only one, but expecting to add more)

 Uses GitHub Action to automatically publish to Docker Hub

build script uses [https://github.com/elgohr/Publish-Docker-Github-Action](Publish-Docker-Action)

## TODO
I have a Git Action to build this, but not sure how to update the label(version) with that.
